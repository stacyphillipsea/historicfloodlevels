# Welcome to my Read Me doc!

## This is the code for my Apprenticeship End Point Assessment Project!

It is to make a Dash App that analyses EA Gauging Station data across the West Midlands, making use of the EA Hydrology API
It calculates peak levels for given storm events over the winetr of 2023-2024, visualises them in charts and tables, and compares them to historic peak levels to provide context.

I have already done loads of work on this before using Git Hub.

## Functionality that is currently working
* Double dropdown menu 
* Peak graph and peak table
* All dates throughout are formatted as I want them to be
* The download data button currently works well
* Peak plot is being loaded into a Powerpoint that can be downloaded locally
* Have downloaded and stored the data_dict as a JSON that is then loaded into the file, instead of calling the API everytime
* Years to peak date column added
* Map showing position of gauging stations

## Things that could be improved
* The top 10 historic values tables is not formatted, and I would like it to show the colours of the storms
* The Historic versus winter chart is fine, but it is a different size when it default loads and then is the intended size when the callback update code is triggered
* The exceptional levels table and the all peak data table are not formatted
* Cannot get the download button for the Powerpoint to work. Created seperate branch (Powerpoint-Download-Attempt)
