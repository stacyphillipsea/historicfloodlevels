# Welcome to my Read Me doc!

## This is the code for my Apprenticeship End Point Assessment Project!

It is to make a Dash App that analyses EA Gauging Station data across the West Midlands, making use of the EA Hydrology API
It calculates peak levels for given storm events over the winetr of 2023-2024, visuliases them in charts and tables, and compares them to historic peak levels to provide context.

I have already done loads of work on this before using Git Hub.

## Functionality that is currently working
1. Double dropdown menu 
2. Peak graph and peak table
3. All dates throughout are formatted as I want them to be
4. The download data button currently works well

## Things that could be improved
1. The top 10 historic values tables is not formatted, and I would like it to show the colours of the storms
2. The Historic versus winter chart is fine, but it is a different size when it default loads and then is the intended size when the callback update code is triggered
3. The exceptional levels table and the all peak data table are not formatted
